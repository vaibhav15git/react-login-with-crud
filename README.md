#### A calculator with dark and light mode provides users with the flexibility to switch between different visual themes based on their preference or the lighting conditions of their surroundings. This feature not only enhances the user experience but also reduces eye strain and improves readability in low-light environments.

#### Overall, the project showcases the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating a functional and visually appealing calculator app, demonstrating the power and versatility of these technologies in web development. The HTML markup provides the structure for the calculator's layout, while CSS styles define its visual appearance and layout. The JavaScript code implements the calculator's logic and functionality, allowing users to perform arithmetic operations and interact with the app in real-time. The use of these three technologies together in the calculator app highlights their ability to work seamlessly together to create a smooth user experience.
